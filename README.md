# 🦷 Dental X-Ray Diagnosis and Visualization with Explainable AI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a smart dental diagnostic system that uses **deep learning** and **explainable AI** to classify dental X-ray images. The goal is to help dental professionals by automating cavity detection and visualizing how the model makes decisions using techniques like **Grad-CAM**.

The system accepts dental X-ray images, classifies them ("Healthy Teeth" or "Unhealthy Teeth"), and returns both the prediction and a heatmap indicating the region of interest. [Watch the live demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZEcJUYynnIG0d-j7VbRLou-Of5xIjlf/view?usp=drive_link)

## 🖥 Deep Learning Model Selection

✅ Our Choice: ResNet50

We adopted ResNet for this project because it offers a balance of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness when working with medical images like dental panoramic X-rays. Its residual connections allow deep feature extraction, making it well-suited for detecting subtle dental abnormalities.

## 📝 Work Done

### Model Architecture and Experiments
- **EfficientNetB3 Model:** An initial model was built using EfficientNetB3 as a base. It was trained and fine-tuned on the dental X-ray dataset.
- **ResNet50 Model:** An alternative model was built using ResNet50. This model was also trained and fine-tuned for comparison.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiments were conducted with different optimizers (Adam, SGD) and learning rates to improve model performance, especially recall for the positive class.
- **Class Imbalance:** To address class imbalance in the dataset, class weights were calculated and applied during the training of the ResNet50 model.

### Explainable AI (XAI)
- **Grad-CAM Implementation:** Grad-CAM was implemented to generate heatmaps that visualize the regions of the X-ray images that most influenced the model's prediction.
- **Visualization:** Functions were created to overlay the Grad-CAM heatmaps onto the original images, providing an interpretable explanation of the AI's decision-making process.

### Web Interface
- **Prediction Controller:** A `PredictionController` in Laravel was created to handle image uploads, call the prediction service, store results in the session, and display them on the `dental-ai.blade.php` view.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Functionality was added to generate a PDF report of the diagnosis results, including the original X-ray, the Grad-CAM heatmap, and prediction details.
- **Frontend Enhancements:** The buttons on the web interface were aligned for better user experience.

## ▶️ How to Start the Project

This project requires both a Laravel frontend-backend and a Python flask API. Follow these steps to get the entire system running.

#### 1. Setup the Python Backend

1.  **Clone the Model Repository:** The `new_efficientnet_dentalAI_model.h5` and `app.py` files are located in the `master` branch model folder. Clone them into your project directory.

2.  **Setup the Python Environment:** Navigate to the new `model` folder and create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd model
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all the required Python libraries for the AI model and backend API (e.g., Flask, TensorFlow).

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow Flask Pillow numpy matplotlib
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server:** Start the backend server, which will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

#### 2. Setup the Laravel Frontend

1.  **Install PHP Dependencies:** Open a new terminal window in the root of your project and install the Composer dependencies.

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

2.  **Set up the Database:** If your project uses a database, configure your `.env` file and run the migrations.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

3.  **Serve the Application:** Start the Laravel development server.

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the web interface.
